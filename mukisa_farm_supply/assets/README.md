Place your shop logo here so the app can use it as a watermark.

Steps:
1. Save your logo image file as `assets/logo.png` (PNG with transparent background recommended).
2. From the project root run:

   flutter pub get
   flutter run -d windows

3. If the watermark is too faint or too large, edit `lib/main.dart` and adjust the `Opacity` value or `width/height` for the Image.asset.

If you want, I can run `flutter pub get` and start the app for you — allow me to run those commands and I'll report back.
